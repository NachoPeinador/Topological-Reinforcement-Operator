This repository contains the research and code for the **Topological Reinforcement Operator (TRO)**, a computational principle that emulates the consolidation of memory engrams in complex networks.

The project validates that functional and resilient memory can emerge directly from a network's topological organization, revealing a principle of **computational parsimony** with biological plausibility.

## üéØ Main Findings

* **üß† Dual Principle (Critical Mass vs. Elite):** Biological networks optimize memory with **"elite"** cores (P95), whereas information networks require a **"critical mass"** (P90) to be resilient.
* **üîó Topological Specificity:** Memory function **collapses (F1-score ‚âà 0)** if the brain network's precise configuration is altered, proving that it's not just the hubs that matter, but how they are connected.
* **‚ö° Computational Parsimony:** The Degree-based TRO is **~96x faster** and consumes **~19x less RAM** than PageRank, while achieving comparable functional performance.
* **‚úÖ Biological Plausibility:** The TRO achieves exceptional performance (**F1-score ~87%**) in memory recovery on the human connectome.
