This repository contains the research and code for the **Topological Reinforcement Operator (TRO)**, a computational method designed to emulate the consolidation of memory engrams in complex networks, from model systems to real-world brain connectomes.

The project seeks to answer a fundamental question: **Can durable memory emerge directly from the topological organization of a network?**

## üéØ Project Implications

* **For AI**: A new path towards more efficient models, where specialization is achieved through topological reinforcement instead of costly retraining.
* **For Computational Neuroscience**: A concrete and reproducible hypothesis on how engrams could be consolidated in the brain.
* **For Network Science**: Evidence that simple principles of connectivity can give rise to complex and resilient functions, such as associative memory.

## üî¨ Reproducibility and Interactive Experiments

This project is structured into two Google Colab notebooks, allowing for a full exploration from the proof-of-concept to the application on real neuroscientific data.

### Data Requirements

To run the experiments with biological connectomes, it is necessary to download the datasets from their original sources and place them in a folder named `data/` in the project's root directory.

* **Macaque Connectome**: [Download from Network Repository](https://networkrepository.com/bn-macaque-rhesus-cerebral-cortex-1.php)
* **Human Connectome**: [Download from Network Repository](https://networkrepository.com/bn-human-BNU-1-0025890-session-1.php)

### 1. The Core Experiment: TRO on Graph Networks and Connectomes

This notebook is the heart of the project. It demonstrates the complete TRO pipeline, from training a GNN to functional validation on multiple datasets, including the macaque connectome.

### 2. The Journey into the Brain: TRO on the Human Connectome

This notebook focuses on applying the TRO directly to a digitized human brain, exploring whether the same mathematical principles can identify a "memory core" in the brain's connection network.
