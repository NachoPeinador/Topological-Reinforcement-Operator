        "Welcome to this interactive experiment where we will explore how the **Topological Reinforcement Operator (TRO)** works inside a **digitized human brain**.\n",
        "\n",
        "The big question guiding us is:\n",
        "👉 **Can we find a “memory core” (engram) within the brain's connection network using only mathematical principles of connectivity?**\n",

        "---\n",
        "### 🌍 What will we do here?\n",
        "1.  **Load a real human connectome** — a map of brain regions and their connections.\n",
        "2.  **Calculate the importance of each region** (node) using metrics like:\n",
        "    * **Degree** (how connected a node is).\n",
        "    * **PageRank** (the algorithm that made Google famous 🕸️).\n",
        "3.  **Identify the top 5%** of the most influential nodes — our candidates for a **biological engram**.\n",
        "4.  **Visualize the connection distribution**, which should follow a **power law**, typical of complex networks.\n",
        "5.  **Compare results** between different metrics to verify if the core of “super-hubs” is robust.\n",
        "6.  **Final step: Memory Retrieval 🧪** — we will apply a protocol inspired by the Cora and Pubmed experiments to test if this core can reconstruct forgotten information.\n",

        "\n",
        "The figure shows the distribution of **normalized degree centrality** in the human connectome (BNU_1), plotted on a logarithmic scale. As expected in a large-scale biological network, the distribution follows a **long-tail** shape, which is characteristic of power laws.\n",
        "\n",
        "This pattern signifies that most nodes have a low degree, while a select minority concentrates an extraordinarily high number of connections. This elite group of nodes—the so-called *hubs*—is precisely the structural condition that allows the **Topological Reinforcement Operator (TRO)** to consolidate a robust engram.\n",
        "\n",
        "The red dashed line marks the **95th percentile**, the threshold we use to define the engram core. The nodes to the right of this threshold constitute the *super-hubs*, which concentrate an influence at least an order of magnitude greater than the average. In the context of the paper, this finding corroborates that the human connectome shares the same organizational principle as artificial datasets like Pubmed or Cora: a heterogeneous and highly centralized structure, ideal for the emergence of associative memories."

        "\n",
        "To add an extra layer of validation to our findings on the human connectome, we perform one final comparative analysis. Calculating metrics like Eigenvector or Betweenness centrality on a graph with millions of edges can be computationally prohibitive.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, we use **PageRank**, a Google algorithm designed to measure influence in massive networks, as an efficient and robust approximation of Eigenvector centrality.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Methodology\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  We isolate the **giant component** of the human connectome to ensure analytical consistency.\n",
        "2.  We calculate **Degree** and **PageRank** centrality for all nodes in this component.\n",
        "3.  We apply our **95th percentile** selection criterion to identify the engram core according to each metric.\n",
        "4.  We compare the **activation ratio** (the mean centrality of the core divided by the mean of the rest) to see which operator creates a stronger differentiation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The objective is to corroborate whether the \"super-hub\" structure we identified with Degree is also captured by another relevant influence metric like PageRank."

        "This means that although degree already showed a clear elite of *super-hubs*, PageRank reinforces this differentiation even further. In other words, **the structure of hyper-influential nodes does not depend on the metric used**: both degree and PageRank capture the same phenomenon of extreme connectivity concentration.\n",

        "## 📊 Key Findings\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Perfect recovery (Recall = 1.0, Forgotten node recovery rate = 1.0)**: all nodes from the original core and all \"forgotten\" nodes were reactivated after the diffusion process.\n",
        "- **Low precision (~5%)**: consistent with observations in previous datasets, the recovery is accompanied by an “associative penumbra,” reflecting a contextual activation pattern typical of distributed memories.\n",
        "- **Consistency across metrics**: both *Degree* and *PageRank* produce practically identical results, confirming that even a criterion as simple as degree is sufficient to identify the critical hubs of the engram.\n",
        "- **Demonstrated scalability**: the method worked on a graph of **~172,000 nodes and over 15 million connections**, with no loss of efficiency or robustness.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🔬 Implications\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Biological validation**: The existence of a “super-hub” core (the top 5%) confirms that real brain topology is optimally organized for a mechanism like the TRO to function.\n",
        "2.  **Plausible mechanism for associative memory**: The ability to recover complete information from a partially damaged pattern suggests that the brain could leverage similar principles of topological diffusion.\n",
        "3.  **Universality of the principle**: From artificial citation networks to a real human connectome, the same topological mechanism produces the same effects: memory consolidation and resilience.\n",

        "- Apply the TRO to other available connectomes (human and other species) to study structural variability.\n",
